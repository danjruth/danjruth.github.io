## Code

This page lists Python packages I've developed for my research.

### Simulations of point-particles in flows

I developed code in the python package [`pointparticlesinaflow`](https://github.com/DeikeLab/point-particles-in-a-flow) to solve the equation of motion for a point-like particle in a prescribed carrier flow. The animiaton below shows a solution of the Maxey-Riley equation for a point-bubble in a homogeneous, turbulent flow available from the [Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database](http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/).

### Stereo triangulation with multiple cameras

The package [`stereo`](https://github.com/DeikeLab/stereo-triangulation) implements the method of [Machicoane et al.](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.5080743) to calibrate the views of two cameras, and provides code to triangulate objects viewed in both cameras in 3-D space.

### Creating videos using `matplotlib`

I use the code in [`video_creator`](https://github.com/danjruth/videos-with-matplotlib) when making animations of videos and data in Python.
