## Research

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Coletti Group](https://ifd.ethz.ch/research/group-coletti.html), which is part of the [Institute of Fluid Dynamics](https://ifd.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich. During my PhD, I studied the dynamics of **gas bubbles** in **turbulence** in the [Deike Lab](https://ldeike.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, with applications to gas transfer at the ocean surface.

Broadly, I am interested in **multiphase turbulent flows** and the **experimental and numerical techniques** used to study them.

### Turbulence near free surfaces

A free surface such as the ocean-atmosphere interface will modify the structure of a turbulent flow, and wind acting at a free surface can generate turbulence in the water below.

I study free surfaces experimentally: on the left in the animation below, **homogeneous turbulence** is generated in the bulk of a liquid by arrays of randomly-actuated synthetic jets; on the right, **wind** blown along the water surface in a long channel induces both **surface gravity waves** and **turbulence** in the water. In both setups, **particle image velocimetry** is used to obtain the vorticity fields (shown in red and blue), and **laser-induced fluorescence** is used to locate the air-water interface (shown in cyan).

### Turbulent break-up of bubbles

In a turbulent flow, bubbles will break apart due to stresses from the surrounding turbulent liquid if they are large enough that surface tension is incapable of preventing severe deformations. Knowledge of the **dynamics of the break-ups** and the **distribution of bubble sizes** that are produced is important to modeling bubble-mediated gas transfer, as occurs with breaking waves on the ocean and in industrial bubble column reactors.

The animation above shows the break-up of a bubble that is initially much larger than the scale at which surface tension could counteract turbulent stresses.

### Bubble rise dynamics in turbulence

The speed at which bubbles rise through turbulence affects the time available for their gases to diffuse into the surrounding liquid. We studied this using **stereoscopic imaging** of bubbles in a laboratory turbulent flow (shown below) and **[point-particle simulations](./code) of bubbles in homogeneous, isotropic turbulence**.

### Pinch-off of air bubbles deformed by tubulence

Bubbles broken apart by turbulence can adopt **significantly deformed shapes** during the break-up process. Here, we showed that turbulent deformations to a bubble pinching off from a needle can **persist throughout the pinch-off process**, even when the scale of the collapsing neck shrinks below the turbulent scales.

### Air entrainment by breaking waves

Breaking waves entrain air bubbles under the ocean surface, which enhance the flux of mass between the ocean and atmosphere. We studied air entrainment in a **wind-wave channel** (in which water waves are created by the combined action of a mechanical wavemaker and air blowing over the water surface). The video below shows a **three-dimensional reconstruction** of the **bubble trajectories** underwater, obtained with the images recorded from two side-by-side cameras shown in the foreground (one of which is enlarged for clarity in the background).
