## Research

I study the dynamics of gas bubbles in turbulence in the [Deike Lab](https://ldeike.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University.

### Bubble rise dynamics in turbulence


### Turbulent break-up of bubbles


### Pinch-off of air bubbles deformed by tubulence


## Software

### Stereoscopic triangulation

### Lagrangian simulations of point-like particles in flows

### Movies with `matplotlib`
