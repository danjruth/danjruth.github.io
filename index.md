## Research

I study the dynamics of gas bubbles in turbulence in the [Deike Lab](https://ldeike.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University.

### Bubble rise dynamics in turbulence

The speed at which bubbles rise through turbulence affects the time available for their gases to diffuse into the surrounding liquid. Using **stereoscopic imaging** of bubbles in a laboratory turbulent flow and **point-particle simulations of bubbles in homogeneous, isotropic turbulence**, we identified the non-linear drag force acting on the bubbles as the cause of the observed reduction in average rise velocity with turbulence.

The animation above shows experimentally-obtained three-dimensional bubble trajectories and a 2-D slice of the turbulent flow-field obtained with particle image velocimetry.

### Turbulent break-up of bubbles

In a turbulent flow, bubbles will break apart due to stresses from the surrounding turbulent liquid if they are large enough that surface tension is incapable of preventing severe deformations. Knowledge of the **dynamics of the break-ups** and the **distribution of bubble sizes** that are produced is important to modeling bubble-mediated gas transfer, as occurs with breaking waves on the ocean and in industrial bubble column reactors.

The animation above shows the break-up of a bubble that is initially much larger than the scale at which surface tension could counteract turbulent stresses.

### Pinch-off of air bubbles deformed by tubulence

Bubbles broken apart by turbulence can adopt **significantly deformed shapes** during the break-up process, unlike the symmetrical bubbles studied in many well-controlled laboratory experiments on bubble pinch-off. Here, we showed that turbulent deformations to a bubble pinching off from a needle can **persist through the pinch-off process**, even when the scale of the collapsing neck shrinks below the turbulent scales.
