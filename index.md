## Research

I study the dynamics of **gas bubbles** in **turbulence** in the [Deike Lab](https://ldeike.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, with applications to gas transfer at the ocean surface. Broadly, I am interested in **multiphase turbulent flows** and the **experimental and numerical techniques** used to study them.

### Turbulent break-up of bubbles

In a turbulent flow, bubbles will break apart due to stresses from the surrounding turbulent liquid if they are large enough that surface tension is incapable of preventing severe deformations. Knowledge of the **dynamics of the break-ups** and the **distribution of bubble sizes** that are produced is important to modeling bubble-mediated gas transfer, as occurs with breaking waves on the ocean and in industrial bubble column reactors.

The animation above shows the break-up of a bubble that is initially much larger than the scale at which surface tension could counteract turbulent stresses.

### Bubble rise dynamics in turbulence

The speed at which bubbles rise through turbulence affects the time available for their gases to diffuse into the surrounding liquid. We studied this using **stereoscopic imaging** of bubbles in a laboratory turbulent flow (shown below) and **[point-particle simulations](./code) of bubbles in homogeneous, isotropic turbulence**.

### Pinch-off of air bubbles deformed by tubulence

Bubbles broken apart by turbulence can adopt **significantly deformed shapes** during the break-up process. Here, we showed that turbulent deformations to a bubble pinching off from a needle can **persist throughout the pinch-off process**, even when the scale of the collapsing neck shrinks below the turbulent scales.
